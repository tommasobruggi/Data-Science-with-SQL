# Data-Science-with-SQL
This is a data science project using SQLite on the Yelp database as part of the "SQL for Data Science" course on Coursera.

## Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part project. In the first part, I provide answers to a series of questions that help profile and understand the data. Proper formatting and comments are used throughout to ease reading.

In the second part of the project, I come up with my own inferences and analysis of the data for several research questions (see FinalProject file). Post-analysis, I provide comments and a brief discussion of findings, including their statistical significance.
